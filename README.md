This project consists of docstrip batch job files that can be compiled
with LaTeX to create bibliography style files for use with BibTeX.

The files are based on, and derived from, Patrick W. Daly's 
custom-bib LaTeX package.  To use them, you must first install
custom-bib, copy the dbj files into the directory, and then
run LaTeX on the dbj files to create the bst files.
